# Transversality and the Three Way Fight Tradition of Anti-Fascism*

## Abstract

This paper introduces the Three Way Fight tradition of militant anti-fascism that emerged in the late nineties and early noughts in North America. How questions of theory arose from writers in dialogue with the anti-fascist militants around Anti-Racist Action, resulting in an exchange of texts between Don Hamerquist and J Sakai, published as 2002's "Confronting Fascism". And how that in turn led to the establishment of the Three Way Fight blog to continue the discussion. We outline the main strategic differences between the Three Way Fight perspective and the traditional "two way" orthodox Marxist view going back to the Dimitrov line adopted by the 1935 Comintern and reiterated in the post-war period by the Black Panthers, amongst others. We then look at how Guattari's notion of transversality maps onto the key strategic perspectives of the Three Way Fight. How Guattari's transversality allows us to stand Althusser on his head and see that subjectifying interpellations are always in relation to big-S Subjects (race, nation, masculinity) that cut diagonally across class. How a theory of nationalism as a transversally subjectifying identitarian ideology allows us to transcend the shallow critique of the Dimitrov line that both reduces fascist ideology to epiphenomenal "false consciousness" propounded by demagoguery, while simultaneously framing "outraged national sentiments" as natural and legitimate. Finally we touch on how a transversal approach to class solidarity and militant anti-fascism can help us to transcend the sterile confrontation between radical-liberal horizontalism and class-reductionist verticalism, while moving beyond the liberal pandering of Popular Frontism.

## Preliminary Comments and Orientation

First, on identity, to avoid any confusion, I am not the Cardiff University academic Paul Bowman who covers Cultural Studies and martial arts, Ranciere, etc. I'm not an academic, I don't have a doctorate, I've just been involved in militant anti-fascism since being a founder member of Leeds AFA in 1986.

This is a paper in two parts. First introducing the Three Way Fight theory tendency, coming out of the US militant anti-fascism movement. Secondly covering the background and concept of transversality and my own take on how that can be used to inform an ideological and strategic analysis of both the opposition (the far right) and our own praxis as militant anti-fascists. 

I want to emphasise, at the outset, that these two parts do not have equal standing. The first is the product of a collective of people working together for over two decades. The second is just my own speculations resulting from my personal research into ideology theory, from an antifa orientation, over the last four years. For those of you who are primarily interested in hearing about the Three Way Fight, feel free to not worry about the second part too much. It's here really as a very preliminary sketch, based on work in progress, and I include it more by way as a spur to further discussion than a final position. The second part of this paper comes out of a much longer research project on Ideology and Practice and includes material from my forthcoming chapter "Ideology and Oppression" in that project.

## The Three Way Fight problematic - a brief history and introduction

So what is the Three Way Fight tradition of anti-fascism, for those who haven't heard of it so far? Prosaically it is the name of a website[^1] (originally a blog) set up 20 years ago in 2004 in the USA. More informatively, the blog itself was set up to continue a conversation between a minoritarian. predominantly anarchist strand within Anti-Racist Action and a number of associated or supportive voices from the 60s generation of heterodox Marxists. Specifically an exchange of views between Don Hamerquist and J Sakai, both of that latter cohort, was published in 2002 as "Confronting Fascism: Discussion Documents for a Militant Movement"[^2] and the blog was established a couple of years later to continue the discussion. 

The themes of the initial and subsequent discussion were around taking fascism seriously as an autonomous force, rather than simply an instrument of "*the most imperialistic elements of finance capital*"[^3]. The dual inspiration for these debate was firstly the experience of fascist attempts to infiltrate the "Battle of Seattle" era anti-globalisation movement under third positionist postures. And secondly, perhaps more significantly, the cultural shock of 9/11 and the sudden realisation that the biggest blow struck to US imperialism for decades, came not from the left, but from a far-right "anti-imperialist" direction, namely Al Qa'ida. Chicago ARA produced a position paper with the suggestive title "Them, Them and US"[^4] which in many ways crystallised the core theme of the Three Way Fight.

Thankfully, 20 years later, we now have a number of printed documents in the shape of newly published books that you can all access through your libraries. So before going further with my introduction to the tendency I'm going to signpost those now as vital resources.

First of all, is the website itself. Above all the important "About" page[^5] which has evolved over the past 20 years and now, for the 20th anniversary site upgrade and relaunch, also includes a concise but considered history of the tendency itself. I'm going to interject a quick quote from the About statement here, because it's useful for anyone who hasn't read it before:

>Three Way Fight is a project that promotes revolutionary anti-fascist analysis, strategy, and activism. Unlike liberal anti-fascists, we believe that “defending democracy” is an illusion, as long as that “democracy” is based on a socio-economic order that exploits and oppresses human beings. Global capitalism and the related structures of patriarchy, heterosexism, racial and national oppression represent the main source of violence and human suffering in the world today. Far right supremacism and terrorism grow out of this system and cannot be eradicated as long as it remains in place.  
  
> At the same time, unlike many on the revolutionary left, we believe that fascists and other far rightists aren’t simply tools of the ruling class. They can also form an autonomous political force that clashes with the established order in real ways, or even seeks to overthrow global capitalism and replace it with a radically different oppressive system. We believe that in this period fascism poses several different kinds of threats: fomenting physical attacks on oppressed communities, bolstering supremacist and authoritarian tendencies among mainstream conservatives and liberals, and—a threat often overlooked—exploiting popular grievances and mis-directing anti-elite, anti-system anger away from liberatory politics.  
  
> Leftists need to confront both the established capitalist order and an insurgent or even revolutionary right, while recognizing that these opponents are also in conflict with each other. The phrase “three way fight” is short hand for this idea (although in concrete terms there are more than three contending forces). Our work confronts complexities in the dynamics between these three poles that are often glossed over. We point out, for example, that repression isn’t necessarily fascist — anti-fascism itself can be a tool of ruling-class repression (as was the case during World War II, when anti-fascism was used to justify strike-breaking and the mass imprisonment of Japanese Americans, among other measures). And we warn against far-right efforts to build alliances with leftists as well as fascistic tendencies within the left (as when leftists promote conspiracy theories rooted in anti-Jewish scapegoating).

So much for the first signpost. Second is the book published earlier this year "Three Way Fight: Revolutionary Politics and Anti-Fascism" (Three Way Fight 2024). The introduction, by Matthew Lyons and Xtn Alexander, is a far more in-depth introduction to the tendency than we have space for in this paper. Thirdly, Matthew Lyons'  "Insurgent Supremacists: The U.S. Far Right's Challenge to State and Empire" (Lyons 2018) is, in my opinion, the most comprehensive monograph by the writers working in this tradition and a major contribution to the theorisation of the far right, not only in the US, but generally. Fourthly, last year's book "We Go Where They Go: The Story of Anti-Racist Action" (Schwartz et al 2023) gives the background story on the movement out of which the Three Way Fight emerged. Finally, Michael Staudenmaier, one of the authors of "We Go Where They Go" and who wrote the Afterword for Three Way Fight, the book, has an earlier book (Staudemaier 2012) on the history of the Sojournor Truth Organisation (henceforth STO), that is also worth a look. 

One of the earliest documents in the Three Way Fight book, that prefigures the core perspective (or problematic, in the French sense), is the 1982 "Theses on Fascism" by the STO, which is a truly remarkable text, in many ways decades ahead of its time. Thesis 4, for example says

> To understand fascism as growing out of the crises endemic to capitalism is not to say it is a simple tool of the capitalist class. One important element in fascism is its autonomous character, expressed in a mass movement among the sectors of the population who have been dislocated by the capitalist crisis and alienated from the traditional institutions of conciliation and repression. Fascism contains an anticapitalist "revolutionary" side that is not reducible to simple demagogy.

The word "demagogy" is the clue to one of the targets of what these these are re-thinking. Which is the Dimitrov line, adopted by the 7th Congress of the Comintern[^6]. The famous soundbite of which is 

>”*Fascism is the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, the most chauvinistic, the most imperialistic elements of finance capital*”

A version of which was adopted by the Black Panther Party. And historically, support for the Panthers' line against the criticisms of the Progressive Labor Party, was one of the unifying factors that defined the RYM II strand of the SDS split that the STO and the rest of the New Communist Movement came out of. So to turn around in 1982 and declare it was time to think outside the box of the Dimitrov Line - with its dismissal of fascist ideology as mere "demagogy" - was a brave theoretical move on the part of the STO.

I draw attention to this, specifically, because the Three Way Fight, while it is in many ways a problematic sufficient to itself as an approach to anti-fascist theory and praxis, is also, at the same time, in dialogue with the various historical lines of the communist tradition. And in that "external" aspect, one of the defining features of the Three Way Fight is its rejection of the Dimitrov Line and the associated Popular Front strategy.

And on that topic I want to make one final act of signposting, that is to Devin Zane Shaw's comprehensive article on the Dimitrov Line, and the critique thereof from the Three Way Fight perspective in  "Notes for a Critique of Dimitrov, the Orthodox Line on Fascism, and the Popular Front Strategy"[^7]. Devin has done all the heavy lifting on this topic, so I'm just going to ride on his coat-tails and say everything you ever wanted to know about the Dimitrov line, but were afraid to ask, it's all there and you should read it!

Of course, one of the big differences between the US and Britain and Ireland in the post Vietnam War political landscape is that the space outside of the "official" Communist Parties that was filled by the Maoism of the New Communist Movement on that side of the pond, was mostly filled by more Trotskyist-tradition groups here. Perhaps why the discourse on the Dimitrov line is maybe less familiar here. While Trotsky obviously had his differences with that line (that in turn included specifically targeted attacks on his own position), his rejection did not amount to the kind of departure that the Three Way Fight position has taken. While a more detailed account of that might be worth drawing up, that is a job for another day and outside of the scope of this particular paper.

Before moving on, I want to quote a recent summary or restatement of the core principles of the tradition that Matthew Lyons made just last month in an article on the site[^8], relating to Trump and MAGA in light of the impending election.

> Fascism is a category we impose on political phenomena to help make sense of them. The question isn’t whether a given conception of fascism is “true,” but whether it’s more or less useful, both analytically and strategically, for understanding political connections and differences. A three way fight approach argues that it’s most useful to think of fascism as an autonomous political force that makes a radical break with the established order, intensifying existing hierarchies in many ways but also challenging established elites for power. Three way fight politics also warns that there is nothing inherently fascist about dictatorship, racial oppression, or even genocide, and that even anti-fascism can be used to advance political repression against liberatory forces.

That last point is worth emphasising against the background of general discourse where fascism is commonly associated with repression or authoritarianism as a difference of quantity rather than quality. And in a way that is often coded morally rather than analytically. Yes, Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile was murderously repressive and bad by any reasonable moral compass. But it was a product of the existing state military apparatus and established elites rather than the kind of autonomous far right grassroots movements the three way fight perspective is oriented towards dissecting. 

Having re-iterated that point, signposted some useful sources and given some flavour of the three way fight perspective or problematic, I will move onto the second part of this paper.
## Transversality

Transversality is not a particularly familiar word. The most common response from friends and comrades when they asked what this paper was going to be about and I told them it was about anti-fascism and transversality was: "what's that?" The term itself was coined by Felix Guattari in a paper to first International Psychodrama Congress in Paris in 1964[^9], so it actually predates the coinage of the more familiar "transgender" (by American psychiatrist John F. Oliver[^10]) by at least a year. Which is to say, that the two terms have independent origins and neither derive from the other, for clarity.
### Tranversality's origins in social psychology - Guattari

Guattari, of course, is more famous as one half of the Deleuze and Guattari double-act. But long before he got together with Deleuze he was doing his own thing, both in activism and radical psychiatry. Although it forms one of Guattari's key concepts that stays with him from 1964 throughout the rest of his career, because it doesn't appear in the works he did with Deleuze, it's less familiar than other related concepts of his, like deterritorialisation, for e.g.

Gary Genosko[^11], introduces transversality thus:

> it may be said that transversality belongs to the processual subject's engendering of an existential territory and self-transportation beyond it. The key concepts involved are: *mobility* (traversing domains, levels, dimensions, the ability to carry and be carried beyond); *creativity* (productivity, adventurousness, aspiration, laying down lines of flight); *self-engendering* (autoproduction, self-positing subjectivity), territories from which one can really take off into new universes of reference 

The concepts of mobility and creativity are clear enough, for the third concept of self-engendering I might tie in also the autonomist concept of auto-valorisation, or even Varela's autopoiesis. But the language is a little vague and somewhat arch, in the postmodernist style. Perhaps an easier way in to the concept is to look at what Guattari later sketched out as a contrarian complement to it, when he proposed to

> determine the nature of a coefficient of collective paranoia, a coefficient complementary and inverse to what I had proposed, about ten years ago, as the coefficient of transversality.[^12]

The idea underlying the coefficient of paranoia is familiar to anyone who has ever worked in a large institutionally or bureaucratically dysfunctional organisation. Inter-departmental warfare and paranoia, "cover your arse" priorities, rigid demarcation and immobility, repression of innovation or creativity as inevitably threatening to some or other vested interest, zero-sum game assumptions, "somebody else's problem" default responses, general demoralisation, cynicism and bureaucratic immobility and sclerosis. We've all been there and it's a soul-crushing experience to be trapped within these dynamics.

So if the idea behind the coefficient of collective paranoia is all too easy to grasp, what's the problem that Guattari's countervailing "coefficient of transversality" was made to solve?

In the first instance Guattari's 1964 paper on Transversality was dealing with the problem of institutional psychiatry - namely the unfortunate tendency of psych hospitals to make their patients even sicker than when they first arrived, rather than achieving any positive therapeutic outcomes. Guattari, still then in his Lacanian phase, but already suspicious of, if not outright hostile to, the problem of transference becoming a block to therapeutic progress. In his paper he proposed

>As a temporary support set up to preserve, at least for a time, the object of our practice, l propose to replace the ambiguous idea of the institutional transference with a new concept: transversality in the group. The idea of transversality is opposed to:
> 
> (a) verticality, as described in the organogramme of a pyramidal structure (leaders, assistants, etc.);
> 
> (b) horizontality, as it exists in the disturbed wards of a hospital, or, even more, in the senile wards; in other words a state of affairs in which things and people fit in as best they can with the situation in which they find themselves.[^13]

For Guattari the vertical relationship in dual therapy between doctors and patients lead to the kind of negative transference where the patient learns what the doctor wants them to say and then just reflects it back to them, producing a blockage. At the horizontal level, between fellow inmates in the institution, their individual lack of capacity and disempowerment means that they are also not well equipped to help themselves much beyond maybe a shared covert resistance to the power abuses of the hospital hierarchy.

Guattari's practical solution at Jean Oury's La Borde clinic, in addition to removing the worst abuses common in psychiatric institutions of the time (prison-like conditions for inmates, punitive authoritarian regimes, etc), was the innovation of "*la grille*". This was basically duty roster, on the model of the radical left youth hostels of his younger days, where all people present in the institution, whether working or patients, shared all the tasks of the whole operation, equally in a rotating "grid" (la grille). This relied on the doctors Oury had gathered being committed enough to radical leftist values enough to pitch in with janitorial and cooking work, alongside patients, auxiliaries and other staff. The idea of patients doing the ward rounds and leading the group therapy while doctors did the janitorial work sounds like a crazy idea of putting the lunatics in charge of the asylum. And yet it achieved remarkable results of empowering the patients, in some cases reviving cases of catatonics who had been unresponsive for over a decade in previous settings, back into interacting members of the community. The story is told in greater depth in Francois Dosse's book (Dosse, 2011) which is a remarkable (and often very funny) read.

But Guattari posed transversality not as an absolute, but as a matter of degree, in terms of a coefficient. The patients were not in charge of the clinic, the grille's roster itself was drawn up by Guattari as benevolent dictator. Doctors continued to have case conferences and so on. Guattari used the metaphor of the blinkers on a horse to illustrate the idea of the coefficient. If the blinkers are too tight, the horse may be panicked by the inability to see their surroundings and fearful of collisions with unseen approaches. As the blinkers widen the increased freedom of view brings beneficial results, but too wide and the horse may be overwhelmed by the sight of all the chaos of city traffic around them. 

By analogy, an over-large coefficient of transversality may lead to the complete collapse of organisational structure, Leading to the problem of "*The Tyranny of Structurelessness*", that Jo Freeman described (Freeman 1971) where the more experienced, empowered and high-capacitance members of the atomised collective seek each other out and form informal cliques to "get things done". 

Guattari's idea of transversality ties into his social psychology of the agency and collective power of groups, of the division between subject groups and subjected groups, in turn inspired by Sartre's discussion of "groups-in-fusion" and the "series" alienated groups. I refer once again to Genosko (2011) for a more in depth coverage of this[^14].

### Modal transversality

But now we need to make a pivot to a second sense the word has acquired in its circulation, in the wake of its escape from Guattari, via Brazilian and South American feminism into the feminist anglosphere. Specifically I'm going to quote a passage from Cinzia Arruza's "Dangerous Liaisons" , where she writes:

> Obviously it is true that women's oppression is ***transversal*** and involves all social classes.[^15]

And here is the pivot. We are moving from Guattari's original sense, mainly in a liberatory register, of group dynamics, into a more oppressive register of social, class dynamics. From the micropolitical to the macropolitical, if you will. For the purposes of dis-ambiguation, I'm going to refer to this second meaning as "modal transversality", because it traverses the class lines of a given mode of production. 

Now, at first sight, these two senses don't appear to have anything to say to each other. But if we take Aruzza's usage as a "call to adventure" in the narratological sense, we can travel to the distant land, hopefully slay the dragon of scepticism and return with the theoretical treasure, following Vladimir Propp's wondertale schema[^16]. But first we will need a "magical helper" and for that we turn - somewhat incongruously for a challenge emerging from a feminist problematic - to Louis Althusser.
### Standing Althusser on his head

Now, we are going to stand Althusser on his head in order to  retrieve the rational kernel of his interpellation model from the historicist and structural-functionalist shell. (And its residual Catholicism)

To recapitulate briefly. For our purposes we can distil Althusser's model, sketched out in "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses"[^17] (and expanded in the posthumously published "The Reproduction of Capital") into six theses:

Althusser - 6 theses:
1 Ideology has no history / ideology is eternal exactly like the unconscious
2 Particular ideologies [...] always express class positions 
3 Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence ("Thesis I")
4 Ideology has a material existence ("Thesis II")
5 Ideology interpellates individuals as subjects / all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects (NB reject "individuals are always-already interpellated as subjects" due to reliance on #1)
6 Ideology is doubly specular constituting a quadruple system of interpellation
	1 the interpellation of individuals as subjects
	2 their subjection to the Subject (grand-S)
	3 the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects recognition of each other, and finally the subject's recognition of himself [sic]
	4 the absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be alright: Amen - 'So be it' ['Ansi soit-il']

Briefly, from the ordering above, we reject theses 1 & 2, accept theses 5 & 6 and partially accept the general thrust of 4 & 5, but with significant corrections needed (e.g. resiling from the infamous concept of the ISAs themselves, which Althusser later admitted to Goran Therborn he could no longer sustain[^18]). 

Putting a pin in these "middle" theses (3 & 4), we make the possibly controversial move of rejecting the notion that "ideology is eternal" (and the Freudian analogy) by counterposing the idea that ideology, at least of the interpellating kind (more on that in a moment), is in fact historical and comes into being at the dawn of the modern era, for convenience in the French Revolution. 

Further, that the specific form of subjectification of the modern era is itself a result of the historically novel condition of the proletariat as a class not only of dominated producers (common to all class societies), but of producers alienated from the direct production of agriculture and tendentially reduced to the non-specific character of Abstract Labour. That is to say that the proletariat is not only dispossessed but it is also socially "placeless". 

This placelessness of the proletariat is in contrast to pre-capitalist societies where indirect producers - the artisans of the urbis - are given social place by their trade (or occupational caste), which are in turn incorporated into the pre-modern political superstructure of urban governance through guilds, institutions of apprenticeship, etc. The historically novel placelessness of the proletariat, it's objectification as abstract labour, opens both the possibility, and ultimately the necessity of a compensatory subjectification.

Which leads necessarily to the rejection of Althusser's second thesis that all particular ideologies express class ideologies. The exact opposite is the case. Empirically we see that interpellations such as nationalism, white supremacy, patriarchal male supremacy and so on, have their power and appeal precisely *because they cut across class lines* and, at the limit, even deny the existence or significance of the class divide. Yes, dominant classes may internally embrace Bullingdon Club cultural prejudices about their own superiority over "the great unwashed". But this is one ideology the Daily Mail will never try to rally its readership with. The elitism of the dominant classes has no cross-class appeal, by its nature, and does not have the social utility of a class-transversing ideology.

Moving on to the rescuable rational kernel of Althusser's model, we accept the core idea of interpellation, that ideology interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects (although this has not always been the case, historically). But above all, its the power of the final theses, the quadruple system of interpellation that is most suggestive and, perhaps more importantly, contains within the seeds for a perspective outside of the one-sidedly functionalist model of ideology as simple, top-down class domination.

Like Guattari, Althusser's second moment of the subjection of the subjects to the Subject, grand-S, despite its Lacanian allusions, also reflects Sartre's notion of the "seriality" of the practico-inert group. The dependency of the group to the external point of reference that governs and orders all interactions, etc. 

But then in the third moment there is a surprise twist, the mutual recognition of the subjects and Subject is followed by "the subjects recognition *of each other*" and here, unexpectedly, we see the germ of autonomy, of the possibility of a horizontalism with the potential to escape the pure verticalism of top-down class domination. A potential that raises a possibility that Althusser never fully saw - that of *inverse interpellation*. If the USA is founded on white supremacy, then the possibility exists for Ku Klux Klan to weaponise that same ideology against the federal state itself and the rule of the victorious Northern industrial bourgeoisie in the era of reconstruction - to take a historical example.

Further, when we look at the fourth movement - this infamous "guarantee" - we are immediately reminded of du Bois's famous "*wages of whiteness*"[^19]. Going further than Althusser we can say that so long as everyone behaves accordingly - i.e. the included subjects of these interpellations that are necessarily both inclusive and exclusive, simultaneously - then everyone will "have their place". And what is the watchword of the supremacist bully boy using vigilante terror to police the subaltern? "*Know your place, boy*". 

The centrality of "place" in the social psychology of these supremacist ideologies means we might call them "***placeholder ideologies***". Which hopefully sounds less horrific than my original label of "transclusive ideologies": that  is, ideological interpellations that traverse class lines in a way that simultaneously both includes and excludes (hence "transclusive", an admittedly atrocious neologism).

What then, of those excluded by these inclusive/exclusive interpellations? I've written elsewhere on this subject, under the heading of "Standpoint and Class"[^20]. To be othered by these exclusive ideologies is oppressive, but also holds the potential for the creation of an oppositional standpoint. Through the notion of modally transversal ideologies, centred around social "place", we can give a more precise meaning to the terms "reactionary" and "progressive". Those "tenancy struggles" that fight against any perceived threat to superior status granted by the "guarantee" of the placeholder ideology, we can call reactionary. And those who fight from the standpoint of the excluded for an a more inclusive, universal guarantee for human dignity and right, we call "progressive".

Goran Therborn's criminally neglected "*The Ideology of Power and the Power of Ideology*" goes a long way to developing the potential of Althusser's schema while correcting some of its more egregious errors or lacunae. However his move to replace the "guarantee" of the fourth moment with "qualification" is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it shifts the schema away from the terrain of social psychology and back on to more familiar sociological terrain. (It also attempts to open towards an outreach to the class composition discourse of the Italian operaisti and autonomists). But as the above reference to du Bois indicates, something important is lost when we abandon the terrain of social psychology. Many of the writers looking at the 'unhappy marriage' of Marxism and feminism or the intersection of anti-racism and anti-capitalism have seen value in retaining aspects of social psychology alongside sociology - despite the historical divide between the two paradigms. But the question of what form of social psychology would be adequate to furthering ideology studies, especially outside of the Freudian route taken by the Frankfurt School is a topic too large for this paper.

### Tying it together: Fascism as insurgent counterpower

So what do we recoup, strategically-speaking, from conceptualising oppressive hierarchies and supremacist ideologies as transclusionary placeholder ideologies in this way? Of course, as already mentioned, the *exclusionary* aspect is what makes these ideologies oppressive. But from the perspective of the sociology of power, rather than the ethics of social justice, it's the *inclusive* side that needs more consideration than the label of simple demagogy allows for. 

Above all it is the potential for the constituent power mobilised via inflamed transversal interpellations to overwhelm or overthrow the dissident fraction of the bourgeoisie that is trying to ride the far right tiger. Fascism is built from two directions, from the top-down, yes, but also from the bottom up. And the bottom up dynamic of the insurgent fascist counterpower represents a potential reversibility of the interpellation that is outside of Althusser's original functionalist model, but that history shows us, is a real possibility. 

The economic nationalist fraction of the Weimar industrial bourgeoisie thought Hitler was going to be their puppet, but they ended up dancing at the end of his strings. Like the young lady from Niger in the limerick, they went for a ride on the tiger and came back from the ride, carried inside with the smile of the face of the tiger. (Although admittedly Hitler didn't smile that much in public)

The dissident faction of fixed capital capitalists (in today's case, Big Carbon) represent the top-down, Doctor Frankenstein part of the fascist moment, but the bottom up fascist counterpower - with its own dark constituent transversality - represents the monster that can potentially overwhelm the doctor and overturn the foundations of the bourgeois order and escape the social relations of abstract labour. Reducing one part of the proletariat to slavery while elevating another to an economically parasitic overseer military caste is definitely not communism, but it is still a radical rupture with the bourgeois capitalist social relations - not just at the level of the ideological superstructure, but within the economic base itself. This idea that the Third Reich was not just capitalist "business as usual" with some dictatorial deformations of the superstructure was first raised by Don Hamerquist and J. Sakai in the 2002 discussion documents[^21] and remains one of the "heterodox" contentions of the Three Way Fight tradition. That is to say when we talk of the "revolutionary" threat of fascism, we are not talking just of a political revolution, but also a social revolution, no matter how reactionary.

But if the threat of ending up inside the tiger instead of atop it is obvious to anyone who can open a history book, why would any fraction of the bourgeoisie be crazy enough to take that risk? 

In short the only possible reason for a fraction of the ruling bourgeoisie to reach out for the support of an insurgent counterpower, rather than pursuing their interests within the existing ruling class consensus, is if they can't win the consensus around to the position that they want, or even existentially need. 

I call this the "bourgeois disunity thesis". That is, a situation where there is and existential threat to the sunk cost fixed capital of a non-hegemonic fraction of the bourgeoisie who is prepared to gamble with social chaos, even at the potential risk of losing control of the situation, rather than "go gently into that dark night". And to do anything serious about climate change we need to make Big Carbon capitalists not just incur losses, but to be totally ruined, to be absolutely clear. Which for them is a fate indistinguishable from death, so we cannot expect them to do anything else than fight to the death to resist the change necessary to secure humanity's future. When Greta Thunberg fights climate inaction in an antifa t-shirt and Palestinian keffiyeh, it's not because she's a slavish follower of woke fashion, but because she can connect the dots. Mass migration and climate change may be distinct issues, but they are not separate, independent ones. They're inextricably linked. And so are our struggles - against fascism and climate extinction both.

But the thesis of bourgeois disunity is literally unimaginable in the old classical and neo-classical Marxist paradigms that took monolithic bourgeois unity as an unquestionable tenet of historical materialism. Unless we are reassured by the old class reductionist assumption of the classical paradigm that fascism is only a response to the threat of an insurgent left - in which case we can all rest easy, given the current weak state of the left - we have to look again at the historical evidence through unblinkered eyes. And this again is part of the Three Way Fight's rupture with the classical paradigm.

The fundamental error underlying class reductionism is to apprehend class at too high a level of abstraction away from its concrete reality. If the interests of the bourgeoisie are seen at the abstract level of defending and increasing the general profit rate, then it stands to reason - within a historical materialist framework  - that they are an indivisible monolith. But if we view them as having interests tied to their concrete, imperfectly liquid capital investments, then we can see that they are capable of having conflicts of interests amongst themselves and the concomitant risks of factionalisation and even, at the limit, of political decomposition of the class, in operaist (i.e. post-classical[^22]) terms. The solution to the impasses and aporias of the classical paradigm is not the abandonment of basic framework of historical materialism - as the radical liberals would propose - but rather to make our analyses of classes and conjunctures more concrete and less abstract.

The collective failure of the left to grasp and deal with the stakes of the fundamental paradigm shift, is one of the reasons we have been collectively unable to draw up a balance sheet of the errors of the Third Period. Yes, everybody tut-tuts at "social fascism" and "*Nach Hitler, uns!*". But do we have a shared account of the theoretical roots of those errors, other than blaming poor leadership of the Comintern? So far we do not. And we need to do better.

### The materiality of constituent power - or why the AWB never had a chance

We've made use of the language of constituent power (or counterpower) and constituted power, without properly introducing our sources for these two terms. Again a fuller discussion is out of scope for this paper, due to reasons of space, but two reference points can be registered. First, of course, is Guattari's old comrade and sometime collaborator - Toni Negri. Negri's "Insurgencies"[^23] is a key text on the constituent vs constituted power dichotomy. But perhaps a more accessible (and more concise) treatment can be found in Mikkel Flohr's excellent paper from earlier this year[^24].

But to return to Althusser's thesis of the materiality of ideology, I want to raise the example of South Africa's Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) that briefly threatened to violently resist the transition from Apartheid to democracy in 1994. In March of that year several AWB militants entered the Bantustan of Bophuthatswana, during civil unrest by the population against the local tin-pot dictator. The appearance of the 90 or so uniformed neo-nazi Boers prompted the rioting population and local police to suspend hostilities long enough to turn on the idiotic interlopers. Subsequently the world's TV news carried the pictures of a Bophuthatswana black police officer showing his disgust at a group of wounded AWB men by unholstering his side arm and coolly executing them, live on camera. To which the world mostly said "fair enough - morons". And the AWB's threats of overturning the government and stemming the progress of history was shown up for the paper tiger that it was.

The point of this little historical vignette is that if we focus in on fascism as ideology - as many liberal writers do - this excludes wider questions of material social power. The AWB may have had impeccably neo-nazi ideology. But even if they had had the support of the majority of South Africa's 10% white population (and they did not), there is simply no way in hell they could have resisted the force of the other 90% of the population by their own counterpower - without the support of the entire South African military state apparatus and the bourgeoisie whose taxes paid for it. The AWB's white supremacy may have been cross-class and transclusionary, but it was not modally transversal because it had no material, physical capacity to put its bodies where its mouth was.  

Granted the *form* of ideology is ideational. But it doesn't follow that its content is not bound by material determinations. If we view ideology in isolation to the social group dynamics that condition it - both social psychological, but also material power and agency - we fall into the error of psychologism or "mere subjectivism". The transclusionary interpellations of placeholder ideologies are not merely psychological. Racism is not the sum total of racial prejudices - it's conditioned and limited by material social power. As the AWB, who were certainly not lacking in ideational ambition, found out to their peril.

And this is where the error becomes clear, of the position of the radical liberals. Those who invert the causation between ideology and social relations to make the latter the product of the former, and not the other way around. Ideology, whether reactionary or progressive, can have material force in the social space when it mobilises masses. But it does not follow that ideology is the unmediated cause or source of social power. It cannot mobilise power that isn't already there *in potentia* or conjure force out of thin air.

The other, accompanying radlib error is to believe that oppressive ideologies come *from outside* of liberal universalism, rather than emanate *from within*. (This is another point of commonality with Callison and Slobodian's descriptive concept of diagonalism[^25], by the way). Here the radlibs agree with Althusser's mistaken belief that ideology is eternal and that the oppressive identitarian interpellations of race, nation and gender pre-date capitalism  and cannot therefore be its product. This is the illusion of "perennialism" (I take the term from nationalism studies - see  Özkırımlı[^26]) which confuses the *experience* of oppression with its *causes*. Yes Jews have been oppressed in Christian lands for centuries, but that doesn't mean that current antisemitism is not a specific ideology that was born in the latter half of the long 19th century in a particular historical conjuncture of nationalism, scientific racism, Bismarck's Kulturkampf and the First Vatican Council's ultramontane turn - antisemitism being the reverse side of the coin to Catholic Social Teaching, lest we forget. Certainly modern antisemitism re-appropriates and re-uses pre-existing tropes and myths from earlier centuries of anti-Jewish prejudice, but that doesn't mean that its current form - "the socialism of fools" - is not a novel ideological response to the challenge of socialism and the workers movement of the late 19th century. The same can be said as regards gender oppression and modern male supremacism, but again that is another paper all on its own. 

In passing a quick note that class reductionism and radical liberalism are popularly held to be mutually excluding points of view - but this is not necessarily so when we look closer at the theoretical errors at the root of both. While most Marxists would reject the radical liberal principle that ideologies produce social relations, rather than the other way around, the perennialist idea that sexism, xenophobia, etc are "residuals" from a pre-capitalist era definitely are not uncommon. Similarly, self-identifying radical liberals (or "progressives" as they more commonly call themselves) may also hold notions of the economic dominant class being always united by abstract profit in general. So the two ideas can actually be held simultaneously, regardless of the self-identity of the holder. Which makes it all the more important to "play the ball not the man \[sic\]" by addressing the ideas themselves, rather than appealing to patriotism of the label or ideological tribalism.

## Mimetic Asymmetry - a Testable Thesis?

It's good for social theory to at least make a nod towards social science. That is, to try and tease out implications of the theory that are, at least in principle, empirically falsifiable or, more optimistically, verifiable. The possibility of mimetic asymmetry is one implication of applying the concept of transversality to political movements of left and right, particularly the far left and far right. 

The concept of "horseshoe theory" is popular amongst the liberal centre, based on observed  far-right borrowings and imitations of tactics, tropes and organisational forms from the far left. By "mimesis" in this context[^27], we don't mean the natural process of imitation that circulates ideas and tactics amongst groups of a similar ideological feather. Rather the process of imitation and borrowing that occurs across significant political divides, in this case between the far left and far right. I have already written about the Nazi roots of horseshoe theory elsewhere[^28]. But transversality allows us to go further in not only disproving horseshoe theory, but also explaining why it was no coincidence that this was a far right coining in the first place.

Every historian and writer on the far right has remarked on the significant amount of borrowing that the far right does in appropriating tactics and ideas from the far left. For horseshoe theory - i.e. the political ontological similarity or near-identity of far left and far right poles of the ideological-political spectrum - to be correct, empirical investigation should see a relative symmetry of borrowing in both directions. That is, the far left should be borrowing a similar amount from the far right as the other way around. That is, a relation of mimetic symmetry would have to hold for horseshoe theory to be upheld.

I stand to be corrected, but I am confident that any empirical investigation will show not mimetic symmetry, but mimetic asymmetry obtains. That in reality the amount of borrowing from the far right by the far left is miniscule to near non-existent. Why? Because if we accept that the average coefficient of constituent transversality is higher on the far left than the far right, and conversely the coefficient of collective paranoia is higher in the latter, then the greater capacity for creativity and innovation will lie, asymmetrically, on the left side of the fence.

But, by the requirements of needing to feed off the energy of insurgent counterpower, albeit reactionary, far right movements are dependent on new ideas and new forms of organisation in order to build their own capacity and self-engender autonomous agency outside of the institutions of the centre right, and therefore need a minimally positive level of constituent transversality of their own, albeit with the support of borrowing innovation from outside. Given their immediate neighbours in the centre right are even more challenged in the realm of creativity than they are, the far right have no option than to go looking for borrowed clothes and ideological cast-offs from their ostensible enemies on the far left. However, this can lead groups like Otto Strasser's Black Front, becoming very exposed to criticism from their more traditionally right-conservative comrades of being "quasi-communist". Hence why they invented the idea of the horseshoe theory to start with. 

## Conclusion

I want to finish by summarising the main points we've covered in this paper. I had originally listed five questions for further inquiry for applying transversality as a tool for looking at fascism and the far right, but I've relegated them to the supplementary materials on the paper, because a review is more in order.

Main points -

* The basic "Them, Them and Us" idea of the three way fight - don't be caught chanting "police protect the nazis" when the riot police are the only thing stopping them from lynching you. The fash and the bourgeois establishment are not always on the same side, but neither is my enemy's enemy my friend in that situation, either

* Fascism is not just state repression turned up to 11. Or simple authoritarianism. Both repression and authoritarianism are tools not infrequently used by regular, non-fascist governments and regimes to secure their own position and put down unrest.

 * The construction of a self-organised, autonomous far right counterpower is a process that requires a degree of creativity, mobility and self-engenderment that we can capture in Guattari's notion of transversality - "constituent" transversality. Mapping that dynamic within emergent fascist groups allows us to target our countermeasures better. Using the principle of "decrease the positive, accentuate the negative", our interventions, overt and covert should seek to reduce the coefficient of transversality and increase the coefficient of collective paranoia, in order to cripple these groups from within.
 
* The mobilisation of an element of constituent power by renegade factions of the bourgeoisie trying to do an end run around their failure to seize control of the apparatus of constituted power by intra-class agreement, is common to both populism and fascist movements. But whereas the populists are "system-loyal" in 3WF language, by remaining within the existing representative democratic structures, the fascist alternative takes the path of building a genuinely autonomous insurgent counterpower.

* Modal transversality is the role of ideological interpellations such as nationalism, racism and patriarchal sexism, that cross class lines and mobilise "included" sections of the working class to defend the status quo, so as to defend their privileged position within it. These placeholder ideologies do not come from outside of the bourgeois liberal order, but were born within it, to mitigate and manage the contradictions of liberalisms limited universalist appeal to the people of no property. They are not the irrational "id" to liberalism's rational "ego", but have equal ontological standing to it, were born with it, and will persist with it until the social relations that created the precarity and placelessness of the proletariat are overcome. The radical liberal dream of eliminating exclusivist and oppressive transversal ideologies and retaining a purified liberal universalism are a delusion.

* The classical Marxist class reductionist view that reduces ideology to class interests and class interests to the abstractions of profit or wages, is not adequate to the historical conjunctures of a divided bourgeoisie that have allowed fascism to triumph in the past. We need to go beyond the limits of such blinkers.

We go where they go!
Our place is everywhere!
No Pasarán!

### Five questions for further inquiry regarding using transversality as a tool for looking at fascism

What can militant anti-fascism in the tradition of the Three Way Fight gain from an engagement with the concept of transversality, in both its forms?

1. An increased understanding of the socio-dynamics of insurgent ideologies and energies within the ranks of the opponent

2. A greater awareness of the need for positive, constituent transversality within our own organising and coalition-building. To find organisational forms that balance shared interests and common goals with existing, socially generated inequalities

3. Via the opposition between mimetic symmetry and mimetic asymmetry, an empirical means of deconstructing horseshoe theory and aiding in the ideological struggle against liberal and centrist attempts to instrumentalise a fetishised anti-fascism, alienated from militant praxis and recuperated for centrist electoralism under the popular front banner

4. The application of the rubrics of coefficients of transversality and paranoia to guide in our threat level assessment of novel far right movements and ideologies, and a more sophisticated strategic guide to our overt and covert interventions in their internal dynamics that go beyond the traditional maxim of "divide and rule"

5. A means to transcend the sterile and unproductive clashing discourses of "anti-idpol" class reductionism and radlib ideological reification in the strategic issue of the relation between ideology and oppression and the social physics of power

These points are neither exhaustive or definitive, but simply to suggest avenues for further enquiry and discussion.

### A note on Ideology Theory

I endorse Rehman's useful distinction between ideology-critique and ideology theory[^29] and in that light my own position is definitely taking the latter route against the former. In fact, with William Clare Roberts[^30], I reject the whole Lenin - Lukács - Frankfurt School/Critical Theory line as a dead end, based the fundamental error of the "false consciousness" trope[^31]. 

Having made use of the contributions of Althusser and Guattari, it would be natural to assume my own position is in the post-structuralist tradition. However I prefer to label it ***post-formalist***, in taking the side of Vladimir Propp in the brief controversy between himself and Levi-Strauss[^32]. Levi-Strauss denounced Propp's sequential narrative structuralism in favour of his own "*a-temporal matrix*". Michael Freeden's concept-centred morphological model[^33] descends very much from the Levi-Strauss side of that divide, so could properly be called post-structuralist. Myself I hold that ideologies convey meaning and humans use narrative forms, especially temporal ones to convey meaning. Therefore, following Propp (hence post-formalist), my approach to ideology studies is a narratological one. 

Specifically, in this context, I hold that politically mobilising ideological assemblages have the form of a **temporal meta-narrative**, I refer to by shorthand as "***the Three Ts***" - Time maps (past), Tenure (present) and Telos (future). For the concept of Time maps I refer people to the work of Eviatar Zerubavel[^34]. By tenure, I mean precisely the type of placeholder ideologies and the proletariats struggle for social place to secure their own social meaning in the face of the nihilism of abstract labour. By telos I mean the concept that history is heading, however precariously, towards a certain pre-determined goal. I would argue that many of the existing theories of fascist ideology - such as Griffin's paligenesis[^35], or Mudde's framing of populism[^36] - are already both temporal and narrative in form, thus being outside Freeden's a-temporal matrix abstract model, so the post-formalist position is perhaps less novel than it might appear. This is obviously a hyper-compressed account, purely for orientation purposes. For further details I refer the reader to my more extended treatment elsewhere[^37]

### Dimitrov and Trotsky Quotes Relevant to the "Dimitrov Line"

Dimitrov extracts:

XIIIth Plenum (Dec 1933) thesis:

> "Fascism is the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, the most chauvinistic, the most imperialistic elements of finance capital. Fascism tries to secure a mass base for monopolist capital among the petit-bourgeoisie, appealing to the peasantry, artisans, office employees and civil servants who have been thrown out of the normal course of life, and particularly to declassed elements in the big cities also trying to penetrate into the working class"

> Comrades, fascism in power was correctly described by the Thirteenth Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International as 'the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, the most chauvinistic, the most imperialistic elements of finance capital'” 

Source: "The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International in the Struggle of the Working Class against Fascism", 1935, Report to 7th World Congress of the Comintern)

> "Fascism is not a form of state power "standing above both classes -- the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," as Otto Bauer, for instance, has asserted. It is not "the revolt of the petty bourgeoisie which has captured the machinery of the state," as the British Socialist Brailsford declares. No, fascism is not a power standing above class, nor government of the petty bourgeoisie or the _lumpen-proletariat_ over finance capital. Fascism is the power of finance capital itself. It is the organization of terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia. In foreign policy, fascism is jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations." (ditto)

> "Fascism acts in the interests of the extreme imperialists, but it presents itself to the masses in the guise of champion of an ill-treated nation, and appeals to outraged national sentiments, as German fascism did, for instance, when it won the support of the masses of the petty bourgeoisie by the slogan "Down with the Versailles Treaty."" (ditto)

> "Surpassing in its cynicism and hypocrisy all other varieties of bourgeois reaction, fascism _adapts_ its demagogy to the national _peculiarities_ of each country, and even to the peculiarities of the various social strata in one and the same country. And the mass of the petty bourgeoisie and even a section of the workers, reduced to despair by want, unemployment and the insecurity of their existence, fall victim to the social and chauvinist demagogy of fascism." (ditto)

Trotsky on Fascism: 

> "Fascism is a specific means of mobilizing and organizing the petty bourgeoisie in the social interests of finance capital" ("Bonapartism and Fascism", 1934). 

> "Fascism in power, like Bonapartism, can only be the government of finance capital. In this social sense, it is indistinguishable not only from Bonapartism but even from parliamentary democracy" (ditto)

Dmitrov vs Trotsky

It's not that there aren't significant differences between the post-1928 Comintern line and Trotsky over important questions of strategy (Trotsky's criticism of the sectarian idiocy of the Third Period "social fascist" policies, "Nach Hitler, uns", etc, and the cowardly pacifism of Popular Front era pandering to the bourgeoisie and the state rather than organising worker's militias). But from the perspective of the Three Way Fight, Trotsky is still within the two-way fight between finance capital and the proletariat laid out in the Dimitrov formulation.

Technically Sakai rejects Hamerquist's characterisation of contemporary fascism as anti-capitalist, prefering to call it anti-bourgeois (and anti-imperialist) but not anti-capitalist, but at the same time saying it aims to seize state power to "violently reorder society in a new class rule" (p. 95), earlier saying "In it's highest development, as in Nazi Germany, fascism eliminates the dangerous class contradiction of the old working class by socially dispersing & wiping it out as a class, replacing its labour with a new unfree proletariat of women, colonial prisoners and slaves" (p. 91) and "it raises repression to a new level by overturning the class structure, recruiting millions of men into new parasitic State warrior and administrator classes that are outside of production but live on top of it" (p. 90)
[^22]: In parenthesis, I have to clarify my non-standard use of the terms classical, neo-classical and post-classical in relation to Marxist interpretations of class and ideology. For me the classical period open with the reaction to Bernstein's revisionism following Engels's death and lasted until the Nazis rise to power liquidated the SPD, the vehicle of classical Marxism. During this period the manuscripts of what later become "The German Ideology" by Riazonov's hand were not available, so the classical conception of "ideology" (which Bernstein had foregrounded in his revisionist text) was not connected to Marx and Engels writing on the topic. The post-classical period, mainly following WW2, so including Mao, Gramsci's recovered prison writings, etc, up to Althusser - the last of the neo-classicals, in my schema - had access to The German Ideology but chose to misread it in the light of the incompatible views of the classical period. Finally the post-classical period includes the heterodox innovations in a range of areas and themes, from value form theory, "Political Marxism", and so on, but above all in operaismo with the introduction of the class composition conception of moments of class composition, decomposition and recomposition, allowing for a more complex and concrete analysis of class fractioning.
